      <h3>BIG BITE, little kitchen was inspired by the year 2020. Having to stay at home and quarantine under state and national order, during a global pandemic, my parents and I began to experiment a lot in our small home kitchen. With the help of many online recipes and several tedious attempts, we think that we have perfected the recipes on this blog and hope to share them with other at home amateur chefs. We hope that you will find comfort in knowing that many hours were put into both the creation of these recipes and the creation of this application through which I am also able to practice my skills as a fullstack web developer.</h3>
      <br />
      <h3>In this project, I utilized technologies such as React JS and bootstrap to create and render a visually appealing front end that is powered by a backend using the program Contenful, where I was able to host and seed the recipes my family and I have shared with you all.</h3>
      <br />
      <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
